# Hi there ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž

My name is Julia-Lotta and I'm currently studying Front-End development at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm.
When I'm not studiyng I'm consulting for Academic Work, developing a fun game app in React Native for a client.<br>

I have a background in project management, digital marketing and music. I've always been curious to learn new things and gone under the inofficial title "the IT support" my whole life.

### Developer Internship, Istya, Paris
Between October and December 2022 I'm doing an internship as a developer at [Istya](https://istya.co/) in Paris. Doing agile work with techniques like React, React Native, TypeScript, Node, MondoDB and more. Istya is part of the world's biggest startup campus - Station F.
